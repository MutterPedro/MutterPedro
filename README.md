### Hi there 👋

My name is **Pedro Mutter** and I came from a country town on the state of São Paulo, Brazil 🇧🇷. I am a passionate software engineer/architect who found his vocation at 15 when was trying to getting up a server for a game called [**Tibia**](http://tibia.com/). Many years after that I got a bachelor's degree in **Computer Science** 🖥️🥼 from [**UFLA**](https://ufla.br/). I am a lifelong learner, so learning and discovering new things makes my day. Currently, I am working on a specialization degree on **Distributed Software Architecture** from [**PUC-Minas**](https://www.pucminas.br/), besides that, I am always doing smaller courses, bootcamps and reading interesting articles and books. Games (especially RPGs) 🎮👾, soccer ⚽ and music 🎧 are my favorites hobbies.
